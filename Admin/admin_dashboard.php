          <div><h3>A job portal doesn't guarantee that you'll get a job. It's simply a job application tool that allows you to apply for jobs and connect with potential employers. Research job portals carefully before you agree to pay fees to use their job-hunting and job-application services. There are many free job portals, including those on commercial websites and private-company sites, so there's no need to pay for services. However, some job-portal agencies charge employers to list their job openings.</h3></div>
